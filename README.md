## A website presenting the concept of me to the wider world.  

Welcome to my README.md file, it belongs with a page making a short introduction of me, with text on the front page, a music video on the Media page and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn on the links page.

Why have i created this site?

**For 2 reasons:**

 - To annonce the start of my programming journey to the GitHub Community

 - To enter as my first project to the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/se/?nab=1)
